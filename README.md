# tibia-market-helper
Old tool for registering and analyzing Tibia market items for profit.

## Disclaimer
This is an old personal project for managing market items listed in a more complete way that produced more information and kept a history.

Tibia is a game developed by the company [CipSoft GmbH](http://www.tibia.com/abouttibia/?subtopic=aboutcipsoft). I have no affiliation with their company nor with any of their projects.

This project is available here in the hope it can be useful but is simply distributed as is, without warrant of any kind, under the MIT License.

## Notes
All the images previously used in the private project were removed due to avoiding copyright issues.

This is an old project and might require code changes to be usable with newer Qt versions.

## Acknowledgements
This software uses [Qt Toolkit](https://www.qt.io/).
